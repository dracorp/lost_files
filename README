Lost_files

A Perl script searches for lost files on your system, do not belong to any package.

You can specify:
* which directories to look for
* which directories you have to exclude
* which files you have to exclude
* which extensions you have to exclude

Usage
    
    lost_files.pl [options]

Options
    -i              - input file with a list of files to analyze. If this script does not support your system can itself generate a list of files. E.g. for Debian:
        dpkg -L $(dpkg -l | awk '/^[a-z][a-z]\ / {print $2}' 2>/dev/null| tr '\n' ' ') | fgrep -v '/.' > input_file
    -o              - output_file, by default prints to stdout
    -t              - show execution time
    -d              - check also directories not only files
    -s|--statistics - show statistics i.e.
                        number of files/directories to analyze,
                        number of files/directories checked,
                        time of execution,
    -h|--help       - show help
